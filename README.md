# vehicle-access-pedestrian-safety

Here is my initial attempt to create a similar visualiation to what Charlotte Lee made here: https://twitter.com/cljack/status/1352282570747207684?s=20, focusing on Alameda County.

It relies on data from the US Census and Berkeley's TIMS program (which sources data from CHP's SWITRS, I believe).

I've left a ton of comments in the code, to understand how the sources are accessed, combined and visualized. Bokeh is a great tool which powers the visualization.
